    <h2>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a 2012 multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment. 
        It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. Developed for over two years, Global Offensive was released for Windows, macOS, 
        Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 in August 2012, and for Linux in 2014. Valve still regularly updates the game, both with smaller balancing 
        patches and larger content additions.</h2>

        <br/>

        <h2>The game pits two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, against each other in different objective-based game modes. The most 
            common game modes involve the Terrorists planting a bomb while Counter-Terrorists attempt to stop them, or Counter-Terrorists 
            attempting to rescue hostages that the Terrorists have captured. There are nine official game modes, all of which have distinct
             characteristics specific to that mode. The game also has matchmaking support that allows players to play on dedicated Valve 
             servers, in addition to community-hosted servers with custom maps and game modes. A battle-royale game-mode, "Danger Zone", 
             was introduced in December 2018.</h2>

             <h1>GAMEPLAY</h1>

             <h3>Global Offensive has nine official game modes: Competitive, Casual, Deathmatch, Arms Race, Demolition, Wingman, Flying Scoutsman,
                 Retakes and Danger Zone. Competitive mode, the primary gameplay experience, pits two teams of five players against 
                 each other in a best-of-30 match. When playing Competitive, players have a skill rank based on a Glicko rating system and are 
                 paired with and against other players around the same ranking. The Casual and Deathmatch modes are less serious than Competitive 
                 mode and do not register friendly fire. Both are primarily used as a practice tool. Arms Race and Demolition, both based on 
                 mods for previous iterations in the series, were added alongside eight new maps for the modes. Arms Race is the Global Offensive
                  variant of the "Gun Game" mode in other games in the series. Demolition is another bomb defusal game mode, with gun upgrades only
                   given to players who killed an enemy in the previous round. Wingman is a two-on-two bomb defusal game mode taking place over sixteen
                    rounds. Similar to Competitive, players are paired based on a dynamic skill ranking. The Flying Scoutsman mode equips players with only
                     a SSG 08 (known in-game as the "Scout") and a knife in a low-gravity map. Retakes is a gamemode where three Terrorists will defend an 
                     already planted C4 against 4 Counter-Terrorists. Players will also be able to choose a loadout card at the beginning of each round to retake
                      (or defend) the bomb site. Danger Zone is a battle-royale mode in which up to 18 players search for weapons, equipment, and money 
                      in an effort to be the last person or team remaining. Valve also included an offline practice mode designed to help new players 
                      learn how to use guns and grenades, called the Weapons Course. Apart from the Weapons Course, all other game modes can be played online
                       or offline with bots.</h3>
